# Welcome to the ROS2 Nervous System Documentation

This documentation is your comprehensive guide to understanding and using the **ROS2 Nervous System**, a powerful toolkit for building robust and scalable robotics applications.

Whether you are a seasoned robotics engineer or just getting started with ROS2, this documentation will provide you with the information you need to get up and running quickly.

## About The Project

The ROS2 Nervous System project is designed to bring structure and resilience to your robot's software architecture. Inspired by the principles of a biological nervous system, it provides a clear and modular way to organize your code, manage state, and handle communication.

## How to Use This Documentation

We recommend reading the documentation in the order it is presented in the sidebar.

- **To get started**, head over to **[Chapter 1: Introduction to the ROS2 Nervous System](./chapter-1.md)** to learn about the core philosophy and goals of the project.

- **To understand the architecture**, check out **[Chapter 2: Core Architecture](./chapter-2.md)**, which explains the fundamental components and how they work together.

We hope you find this documentation helpful. Happy building!
